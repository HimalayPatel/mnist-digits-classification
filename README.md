# Classification of handwritten digits from MNIST datasubset.
Built a linear neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits (0-9) taken from MNIST datasubset in json format.
Implemented Mini Batch Gradient Descent, ReLU activation function, softmax for classification and dropout to handle overfitting.
Achieved test accuracy of 92.6%.
